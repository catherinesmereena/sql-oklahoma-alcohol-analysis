Predictive Analytics,  
 
Introduction: 
Predicting play types in NFL games is crucial for optimising team strategies and improving 
performance. Coaches rely on understanding play tendencies to refine offensive and defensive tactics, 
while analysts and fans seek deeper insights into game dynamics. Accurate predictions can also 
enhance live commentary and sports betting experiences. This study focuses on developing a 
predictive model to classify play types, such as passes and runs, using game features like down, yard 
line position, score differential, and remaining time. By leveraging data analytics and machine 
learning, the research aims to provide actionable insights, demonstrating the value of data-driven 
strategies in professional football. 
 
Data Cleaning: 
For cleaning the training dataset, I prioritised data accuracy and interpretability by removing 
irrelevant columns such as 'Points Scored by Either Team' and 'Yards Gained'. These columns were 
deemed non-essential for predicting play types. For the 'Down' column, which had less than 1% 
missing values, I filled the gaps using the mode to maintain the dataset's integrity without significant 
data loss. 
 
Outliers in numerical columns like 'Down', 'To Go', and 'Score Differential' were addressed using the 
interquartile range (IQR) method. Extreme values were capped at the nearest valid boundary, ensuring 
data consistency while avoiding distortions. Categorical variables, including 'Offensive Team' and 
'Defensive Team', were transformed into numerical codes using label encoding to ensure 
compatibility with machine learning models. Additionally, numerical columns such as 'Yard Line 0-
100' were standardised to achieve uniformity in scale and prevent skewed model outcomes. 
 
Feature engineering significantly enhanced the predictive power of the dataset. The 'IS_RED_ZONE' 
feature, a binary indicator, was introduced to identify plays occurring within 20 yards of the end zone, 
emphasising high-pressure scenarios. The 'ABS_SCORE_DIFFERENTIAL' feature was created to 
represent the absolute score difference, highlighting game situations where urgency might influence 
play type decisions. These features added contextual depth, improving the model's ability to discern 
patterns. 
 
For the testing dataset, I applied the same cleaning process to ensure alignment with the training 
dataset. Columns like 'Road Team', 'Home Team', and 'Touchdown Details' were removed to match 
the training dataset's structure. Missing values in the 'Down' column were filled with the mode, and 
outliers in numerical features were capped using the IQR method. Additionally, the 'Remaining Time 
in the Quarter' column was converted into seconds, and categorical variables were label-encoded for 
consistency. 
 
By harmonising the training and testing datasets, standardising numerical features, and incorporating 
relevant engineered variables, I ensured the data was prepared for robust predictive modelling. These 
steps minimised biases, improved model generalizability, and preserved the integrity of the datasets. 
EDA: 

For this exploratory data analysis, I explored the relationship between various game features and play 
types (pass or run). The goal was to uncover patterns and trends in how factors like downs, yard lines, 
and score differentials influence play-calling decisions. Visualisations and statistical summaries were 
used to provide insights into these relationships. 
PLAY TYPE DISTRIBUTION 
The overall distribution of play types reveals a higher frequency of passing plays compared to running 
plays. Passing plays are labelled as 0, and running plays as 1. This distribution aligns with the general 
trend of modern football strategies favouring passing due to its versatility and higher potential for 
significant yard gains. Running plays, on the other hand, are situational and often used to manage time 
or maintain field control. 
HYPOTHESIS 1: Teams closer to the end 
zone are more likely to run than pass. 
I hypothesised that plays in the red zone 
(defined as within 20 yards of the end zone) 
would favour running over passing due to the 
reduced field length and increased focus on 
ball security. The binary IS_RED_ZONE 
variable was created to test this hypothesis. 
The results supported this hypothesis: running 
plays were more frequent within the red zone, 
emphasising the tactical shift to minimise 
turnovers and capitalise on scoring 
opportunities. Outside the red zone, passing 
plays dominated, reflecting a strategy to 
cover more ground. 
HYPOTHESIS 2: Later downs 
favour passing plays due to higher 
pressure. 
I hypothesised that as downs progress, 
the likelihood of passing increases due 
to the urgency to gain yardage. The 
analysis confirmed this trend, with first 
downs showing a higher proportion of 
running plays, aligning with the 
strategy to establish manageable 
yardage early in the sequence. On third 
and fourth downs, passing plays were 
significantly more frequent, 
highlighting the pressure to secure a first down or score. 
FEATURE SELECTION 
In the correlation matrix, the most notable relationship with play type was observed with down (-
0.18), indicating a slight preference for passing plays on later downs. Yard Line 0-100 showed a weak 
correlation (0.10), suggesting a minor tendency for passing plays to occur farther from the end zone. 
Variables like ABS_SCORE_DIFFERENTIAL and REMAINING TIME IN SECONDS had 
negligible correlations, indicating that scoring pressure and time constraints do not heavily influence 
play type decisions. 

 
During the VIF  analysis, several features demonstrated high multicollinearity, particularly the home 
team's accumulated score, the road team's accumulated score, and the score differential. These 
features had extremely high VIF values (above 50), indicating redundancy due to their strong 
correlation, as confirmed in the correlation matrix. Since the score differential was directly derived 
from the accumulated scores of the two teams, it was removed to address multicollinearity and 
simplify the feature set. 
After eliminating the redundant features, the VIF values for the remaining features significantly 
improved. Features like 'Down' (VIF = 1.21), 'To Go' (VIF = 1.25), and 'Offensive Team Venue' (VIF 
= 1.02) exhibited minimal collinearity and were retained for modelling. These features contribute 
uniquely to the predictive model by capturing different aspects of game dynamics. 
The finalised feature set includes 'Quarter', 'Down', 'To Go', 'Yard Line 0-100', 'Road Team's 
Accumulated Score', 'Home Team's Accumulated Score', 'Offensive Team', 'Defensive Team', 
'IS_RED_ZONE', and 'Offensive Team Venue'. Collectively, these features provide a comprehensive 
view of the game context while maintaining low multicollinearity, ensuring the robustness and 
interpretability of the predictive model. 
Model Evaluation: 
Model 1 â€“ Logistic Regression 
Logistic regression was chosen for its robustness in modelling categorical outcomes, such as 
predicting play type (pass or run). Using the selected features, the logistic regression model achieved 
an accuracy of 60.1%, demonstrating moderate performance. This provides a solid baseline for 
predicting play types, though there is room for improvement.

The confusion matrix revealed that the model correctly classified 2167 passing plays (0) and 1976 
running plays (1), but misclassified 1788 passing plays as running plays and 861 running plays as 
passing plays. This imbalance is evident in the precision, recall, and F1-scores for both classes. 
Passing plays (0) had a higher precision of 0.72, recall of 0.55, and F1-score of 0.62, outperforming 
running plays (1), which had a precision of 0.52, recall of 0.70, and F1-score of 0.60. The model's 
superior performance in predicting passing plays is likely due to their higher frequency in the dataset.

The logistic regression model identified key features such as 'Down', 'To Go', and 'Yard Line Position' 
as significant predictors of play type. These features were crucial in the model's ability to differentiate 
between passing and running plays. However, the performance metrics indicated that the model is 

more effective at predicting passing plays, likely due to their higher frequency in the dataset. This 
highlights the need for additional techniques, such as further feature engineering or alternative 
modelling approaches, to improve the model's accuracy in predicting running plays. 
Model2:Stepwise Logistic Regression 
Using forward selection, I iteratively refined the logistic regression model by adding features with 
significant p-values below 0.05. The final model included key features such as TO GO, DOWN, 
REMAINING_TIME_SECONDS, YARD LINE 0-100, OFFENSIVE TEAM, and DEFENSIVE 
TEAM, along with the intercept (const). The model achieved an accuracy of 60.2%.

Model Comparison Table:   

When comparing the hyperparameter-tuned logistic regression model to the stepwise logistic 
regression model, notable differences emerged in class-specific performance. While overall accuracy 
was similar (60.99% for the tuned model and 60.24% for the stepwise model), the models exhibited 
different strengths depending on the play type. 
 
For passing plays (Class 0), the stepwise model excelled with a high recall of 91%, correctly 
identifying most actual passing plays. However, its precision was lower at 61%, indicating frequent 
misclassification of running plays as passing plays. This combination resulted in a strong F1-score of 
73%. In contrast, the tuned model demonstrated more balance, achieving a higher precision of 72% 
but a lower recall of 55%, leading to a moderately lower F1-score of 62%. 
 
For running plays (Class 1), the tuned model outperformed the stepwise model significantly, 
achieving a recall of 70% compared to only 15% for the stepwise approach. This indicates the tuned 
model was better at identifying running plays, with an F1-score of 60% versus 23%. 
 
The stepwise model simplifies analysis by focusing on key features like TO GO, DOWN, and field 
position, making it easier to interpret. However, the hyperparameter-tuned model's balanced 
performance and ability to handle class imbalance make it the preferred choice for predicting both 
play types effectively. 
Testing Results on Test Dataset 
I tested the trained logistic regression model on the test dataset to evaluate its performance in 
predicting passing and running plays. The model achieved an accuracy of 60.1%, meaning it correctly 
predicted the play type in 60.1% of the cases.

Final Insights of the Model: 
Key Variables and Their Impact 
The analysis highlights Play Type as the primary outcome, influenced by variables such as TO GO, 
DOWN, and YARD LINE 0-100. These predictors provide critical insights into whether a play is 
more likely to be a pass or a run. TO GO represents the yards required for a first down, with passing 
plays more common in long-yardage situations, reflecting the need for greater gains. DOWN is a 
pivotal factor, with later downs (e.g., 3rd or 4th) favouring passing plays due to time constraints and 
situational urgency. Conversely, running plays are more frequent in short-yardage situations or closer 
to the end zone, emphasising clock control or short gains. These variables reflect real-world play-
calling strategies and are essential for making accurate predictions. 
 
Model Performance 
The logistic regression model, trained using hyperparameter tuning and evaluated on test data, 
achieved an accuracy of 60.1%, indicating moderate success in predicting Play Type. For passing 
plays (Class 0), the model exhibited a precision of 74%, meaning the majority of predicted passes 
were correct. However, the recall was lower at 52%, indicating some passing plays were misclassified 
as runs. For running plays (Class 1), the model achieved a precision of 50% and a recall of 72%, 
demonstrating better identification of actual runs but with more false positives. The model's balanced 
F1-scores of 61% (passing plays) and 59% (running plays) highlight its ability to generalise across 
both classes but reveal room for improvement, particularly in addressing class imbalance. 
 
Application to Game Strategy and Decision-Making 
The model offers valuable insights for strategic decision-making in football. By analysing predictors 
such as TO GO, DOWN, and YARD LINE 0-100, coaches can anticipate opponents' likely play types 
and adjust their strategies accordingly. For example, defensive alignments can focus on defending the 
pass during long-yardage situations or prioritising the run near the end zone. Offensive strategies can 

also benefit from identifying patterns in the opponent's play-calling tendencies. Enhancing the model 
with additional features like player statistics, weather conditions, or team-specific dynamics could 
further improve its reliability and applicability to real-world game strategies. 
 
CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, the logistic regression model provides meaningful insights into Play Type and its 
relationship with situational variables. While the model demonstrated reasonable accuracy on the test 
data, its performance revealed areas for refinement, including improving predictions for passing plays 
and addressing class imbalance. The findings underscore the potential of data-driven approaches to 
inform play-calling strategies, while highlighting the importance of iterative enhancements to 
maximise the model's effectiveness and generalizability.`
