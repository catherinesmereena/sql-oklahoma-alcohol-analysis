PROJECTS  
Franchise Growth Analytics & Lead Optimization  
Built a lead scoring model to optimize conversions by analyzing account activity and engagement. Applied statistical tests (t-test, 
chi-square, Spearman) to identify success drivers. Developed real-time dashboards in Tableau, standardized datasets to reduce 
inconsistencies by 60%, and automated SQL pipelines to enhance reporting and operational decision-making. 
NFL & Housing Data-Predictive Statistical Analysis  
Built play-type classifiers (KNN, Logistic, Random Forest) (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy), boosting prediction accuracy to 73% using 
engineered features like Down Importance and Time Pressure. 
Applied stepwise regression on housing data, identifying square meters and cityPartRange as key predictors (RÂ² = 0.754). 
Refined feature quality using VIF, IQR-based capping, and SMOTE to reduce noise and balance target classes. 
Designed modular ML pipelines for EDA and model tuning in Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Stats models). 
Customer Churn Prediction Model 
Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) with an 85% accuracy rate to predict churn risk. 
Conducted A/B testing & experimental design to refine retention strategies based on data-driven insights. 
Developed a Power BI dashboard for leadership to track real-time churn trends. 
Netflix Content Analytics & Recommendation Optimization 
Analyzed 8,800+ Netflix titles using R and Python to uncover trends in genre, ratings, and viewer behavior. Applied clustering and 
association rule mining (Apriori, Eclat) to improve content recommendations. Conducted EDA and modeling to guide strategic 
decisions in content acquisition and enhance user engagement. 
Excel-Based Business Analytics  
Developed advanced Excel models to solve business problems in inventory management, profitability optimization, and financial 
forecasting. Key projects included EOQ and Monte Carlo simulations, linear programming for profit maximization, and stock price 
forecasting for NFLX and AMZN. Performed cost-benefit analysis and content segmentation using association rule mining. Leveraged 
Solver, What-If Analysis, and MAPE for validation. Delivered actionable insights on pricing, resource planning, and expansion.
